            <p><strong>Hitchcock's Rear Window</strong> is an exceptional example of suspenseful storytelling. Its success relies heavily on the innovative use of <strong>point of view (POV)</strong>. The entire story unfolds from the perspective of <strong>L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries</strong>, a photographer who is confined to a wheelchair and spies on his neighbors.</p>
            <p>This unique narrative style not only engages the viewers but also makes them experience <strong>Jeff's voyeuristic tendencies</strong>. Like Jeff, the audience is limited to a single viewpoint, creating a gripping and immersive cinematic experience. Let's explore some key scenes that demonstrate this remarkable storytelling technique.</p>

        <section id="lisa-scene">
            <!-- <img src="lisa_break_in.png" alt="Lisa in Thorwald's Apartment"> -->
            <video id = "video" src="scene-1.mp4" autoplay loop muted></video>
            <p>One notable scene is when <strong>Lisa Fremont</strong> secretly enters <strong>Lars Thorwald's</strong> apartment. The perspective of the film shifts, and we find ourselves right there with Lisa, in the midst of danger. As the suspense builds up, we gain a deeper understanding of Lisa's brave character. This particular section combines <strong>suspense, adventure, and character development</strong> to create an exhilarating experience.</p>
            <p>The <strong>pinnacle</strong> of this sequence occurs when Lisa and Thorwald make eye contact, showcasing Hitchcock's genius. It's a tense moment that further draws us into the story.</p>

        <section id="jeff-scene">
            <video id = "video" src="scene-2.mp4" autoplay loop muted></video>
            <p>The <strong>climax</strong> takes place when Jeff confronts Thorwald. We are once again aligned with Jeff's perspective, which is now filled with danger. The suspense is very intense as Thorwald enters the apartment.</p>
            <p>The room's <strong>darkness</strong>, occasionally interrupted by the sudden <strong>flicker</strong> of Thorwald's match, intensifies our sense of dread. This climactic scene is a testament to how POV can effectively keep an audience on the edge of their seats.</p>
